# Wine_Quality_Prediction
 This project predicts wine quality using machine learning on red and white wine samples. We applied classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest) and ensemble methods (XGBoost, LightGBM). Random Forest and LightGBM achieved the highest performance, aiding quality control in the wine industry.
